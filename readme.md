# Lightstamp
Livestamp-like library for automatically updated timestamps (like "X minutes ago")
Currently AMD and CommonJS not supported , sorry
# Why?
Livestamp.js and Timeago.js depends on jQuery + Moment. This library depends only on Moment.
# Usage
```html
<span data-timestamp="your_timestamp">fallback</span>
```
